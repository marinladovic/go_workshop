# Data Types

## Built-in Data Types

- string
- Integer values: int (alias for int32), int8, int16, int32, int64, uint (unsigned integer), uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
- Floating point values: float32, float64
- bool

## Boolean operators

==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, &&, ||, !

We can work also with pointers
